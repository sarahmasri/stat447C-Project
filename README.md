# Stat 447C Final Project

## Overview
This course project involves independent work on a topic related to Bayesian Statistics. The project leaves freedom for creativity within constraints designed for pedagogical and fair evaluation.

## Logistics
I am the only contributor to this project. Final copies of the project proposal and project report will be submitted to Canvas. All final and intermediate steps, code, and figures will be stored on this repo. Both the proposal and final report contains a link to this repo.

## Project Theme

This project explores the theme of a ``careful and scientific comparison of a Bayesian estimator with another one, either Bayesian or non-Bayesian". This includes a motivation and background/review of literature of both elastic net regression and Bayesian regression using a spike-and-slab prior. If time permits, I would like to explore the possibility of proposing an extended technique from spike-and-slab regression. 

## Folders
