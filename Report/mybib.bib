  abstract  = "The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in
               response to the growing demand for a public repository for
               high-throughput gene expression data. GEO provides a flexible
               and open design that facilitates submission, storage and
               retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene
               expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not
               intended to replace in house gene expression databases that
               benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to
               facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement
               these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub.
               The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples
               and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic
               hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a
               list of probes that define what set of molecules may be
               detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being
               probed and references a single platform used to generate its
               molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the
               meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO
               repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at
